## Overview

-   Light Detection and Ranging (lidar)
-   The lidR package - a brief introduction
-   Workshop overview

## What is LiDAR?

-   Light Detection and Ranging
-   Active form of remote sensing
-   Measures distance to target surfaces with millions of narrow light pulses
-   Airborne laser scanning performs lidar systematically from aircraft or drones

## LiDAR Data - Point Clouds

-   Discrete returns are aggregated as points in point clouds (LAS/LAZ)
-   These datasets contain geo-referenced points with three-dimensional (XYZ) coordinates, and other attributes; intensity, return number etc...
-   Point clouds can be processed into summaries of vegetation structure with lidR

::: notes
:::

## lidR

-   Package for `manipulating` and `visualizing` ALS data
-   Focused on forestry and ecological applications but broadly applicable beyond
-   Written entirely open source within R-geospatial ecosystem (terra/sf)
-   Runs efficiently with backend C++ code to perform processing
